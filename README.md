# RTL-Sobel-Gaussian-filter
RTL implementation of 3×3 Sobel and Gaussian filters using Verilog HDL.
**Sobel Filter**
  - 3×3 convolution kernel using Gx and Gy gradients
  - Edge detection based on |Gx| + |Gy| magnitude
  - Line buffering and 3×3 window generation

- **Gaussian Filter**
  - 3×3 smoothing convolution using separable Gaussian kernels
  - Noise reduction in image pre-processing
  - Basic pipeline structure implemented
